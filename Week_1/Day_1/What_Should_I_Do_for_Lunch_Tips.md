### Tips

You may use Operators like shown below.  
* `<`
* `>`
* `===`

Work in snipets through the problem, to start off see what values are returned with the given parameters.

Also incorporate loops like:

* `if`  / `else`
* `for` / `of` / `in`
* `while` / `do`

Here's an example to help with Week one day one function:

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
```
